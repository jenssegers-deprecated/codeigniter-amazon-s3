CodeIgniter Amazon S3 library
=============================

This is an adjusted version of the Amazon S3 SDK by tpyo. It allows loading the library in a CodeIgniter like manner. Edit the s3.php config file and load the library:

	$this->load->library('s3');
	
The interface of the class has not been adjusted, the original documentation is located at [https://github.com/tpyo/amazon-s3-php-class/blob/master/README.txt](https://github.com/tpyo/amazon-s3-php-class/blob/master/README.txt)
